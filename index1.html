      <div class="two-col">
<p>My name is Chris Edge and I am a student at Wake Technical Community College in the Advertising and Design program.  I am a father to three children ages 19,18 and 15.  I am engaged and set to marry in April because the pandemic pushed back our plans to get married in October of 2020.  I enjoy playing golf, bowling, D&D, poker, other board games, as well as being out in nature on a mountian hike.  My fiance and I have two dogs and three cats although i don't claim the cats because they can be assholes.  My future plans include obtaining my masters so I can eventually teach at the college level in graphic design and advertising.</p>

        <p>Web design has become so intergral to graphic design that it seems the two are almost joined together in most job descriptions.  I have only a limited knowledge of web design so I am excited to find out more during this class about the strategies and implementation of design in web development.  It is a skill that I know I need to strengthen in order to be a canidate for many positions being offered.  I am hoping that I will be able to show competency in this area by the end of the Associates degree.  I enjoy building from the ground up rather than using something like wordpress. </p>
